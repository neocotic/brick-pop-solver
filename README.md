## Install

In order to install this tool you will need the following prerequisites:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* [Java 8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org)

Once you have all of them installed you just need to do the following:

``` bash
$ git checkout https://github.com/neocotic/brick-pop-solver.git
$ cd brick-pop-solver
```

## Usage

This tool can either be used via the CLI or via its API.

Your device **must** be connected (with USB debug mode enabled) and *Brick Pop* should be open and a game open.

### CLI

``` bash
$ ./gradlew run
```

It can be further customized by specifying Java properties. Take a look at the source code for `BrickPopSolver.java`.

### API

``` java
BrickPopSolver solver = new BrickPopSolver();
Solution solution = solver.solve();

solution.play();
```

A `Configuration` instance can be passed to the constructor for further customization. Take a look at the source code
for `Configuration.java`.

Other methods are also available so please explore the API.

## Device Support

Currently, only Android devices are supported and you will need to have the
[Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) installed as this tool depends on the Android Debug
Bridge (`adb`) to communicate with the device. This means that you'll need to have `/path/to/android-sdk/platform-tools`
in your `PATH` environment variable so that it is discoverable.

This tool has only been tested on a OnePlus 5 so the default configurations match this. The offset and starting point
may need to be changed to match the screen resolution of your device. Eventually, I'd like to have automatic detection
of the grid to avoid manually determining and inputting these values.

## Bugs

If you have any problems with this tool or would like to see changes currently in development you can do so
